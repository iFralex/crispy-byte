### Secure Account System:

Security is at the core of the CrispyByte dashboard, featuring a password-protected account system. This functionality ensures that only authorized personnel can access the platform, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and maintaining operational integrity.

### Dashboard Structure:

The dashboard is divided into two main sections: "Orders" and "Tables."

#### 1. Orders Section:
   - **Order Overview:** Waitstaff have access to a chronological display of all placed orders. Each order is marked with a unique color associated with the corresponding table.
   - **Order Details:** Each order presents crucial information such as order time, table number, and total cost.
   - **Dish Management:** Waitstaff can view dishes ordered by each customer. Selecting served dishes and updating through the dedicated button allows quick synchronization across waiter dashboards.
   - **Reporting Completed Orders:** Once all dishes of an order are delivered, the waiter can mark the order as "Done," removing it from the Orders section.

#### 2. Tables Section:
   - **Table Management:** The Tables section is primarily designed for cashiers, allowing them to view all available tables in the restaurant.
   - **Viewing Completed Orders:** Cashiers can select a specific table and view all associated completed orders. The total price to be paid for all orders is clearly indicated.
   - **Payment and Removal:** After payment, the cashier can eliminate all orders associated with that table with a single click, streamlining post-payment management.

### Operational Advantages:

The CrispyByte dashboard not only optimizes the ordering process but also provides complete control over the status of orders and tables. Waitstaff and cashiers can collaborate efficiently to ensure flawless service, enhancing the overall customer experience.
